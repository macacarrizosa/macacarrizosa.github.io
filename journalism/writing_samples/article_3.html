<p> Residents of Inwood, an Upper Manhattan neighborhood where the heat concentration is higher than in the rest of the city, have several proposals to deal with the problem. They include investing more in parks and river beaches, and improving public transportation and access to bicycles for the community.
</p>

<p>
They also call for more cooling centers and more investment in education and art programs that raise awareness of climate change, according to the proposals, announced Saturday at a presentation  at Harold O. Levy School 52, in Inwood, attended by activists and local politicians.

<p>
These proposals came about after a series of meetings with local residents organized by <a href="https://www.weact.org/" title="We Act" target="_blank"> We Act</a>, a nonprofit organization that encourages low-income communities of color to participate in making in public policy.  
</p>

<p>
State Sen. Robert Jackson and Assemblywoman Carmen de la Rosa, who were present,  are among  the local politicians who have promised to support the plan’s implementation in public legislation.

<p>
Zoé Hamstead, an urban ecologist, explained in an article published by WeAct, that Inwood is a “micro-urban heat island” in Manhattan. This means that heat concentration is much higher there because of such factors as building design and lack of green space. Residents of such areas are “unproportionally exposed to the health risks related to the heat,” such as dehydration or heat strokes, which may require hospitalization or even be fatal, she said. 
</p>

<p> “Inwood has twice as many hospitalizations induced by heat compared to the rest of Manhattan,” said Sonal Jessel, We Act’s policy and advocacy coordinator.
</p> 

<p> 
According to the  2018 Community District 12 Health Profile report, Inwood residents also suffer from more economic stress than other New Yorkers. They have limited access to heat relief such as air-conditioned spaces and newer buildings whose designs that take airflow into account.

“There is a false concept that people of color and their elected officials aren’t concerned with environment issues,” U.S. Rep.  Adriano Espaillat said during the presentation. “The reality is that people of color and low-income rank among the highest in polls as people who care about the environment and the weather, and we can see this today.”
</p>

<p>
This summer We Act obtained public funds  to do research in Inwood. It hosted four informational workshops about climate change that included discussions to identify the community’s priorities.

<p>
During the presentation, residents  had the opportunity to criticize We Act’s proposals before they are formally presented to the authorities.
</p>

<p>
Participants said they were satisfied with the report but skeptical about its implementation. Maggie Clarke, who has a Ph.D. in environmental science, has lived in Inwood for over 50 years and said she had participated in similar meetings. “Unfortunately, these types of reports never go very far,” she said, recalling the meetings  held before the Inwood rezoning agreement.
</p>

<p>
Jessel said the next step is to follow up with the authorities and continue awareness efforts in the neighborhood.
</p>

<p>
“We want to hear the community and learn about what they care about in order to know what legislation and policy we need to support,” de la Rosa said. “These types of meetings are important because ideas come directly from the community, and that’s how government should work.”
