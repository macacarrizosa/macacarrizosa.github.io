<p> The residents of Inwood, a northern Manhattan neighborhood where the heat concentration is higher than in the rest of the city, have several proposals to deal with the problem. Amongst them, investing more in parks and river beaches, improving public transportation and access to bicycles for the community.
</p>

<p>
They also demand more cooling centers and more investment in education and art programs that raise awareness about climate change, according to the announcement of the proposal this Saturday attended by activists and local politicians.

<p>
These proposals came about after a series of meetings with local residents organized by <a href="https://www.weact.org/" title="We Act" target="_blank"> We Act</a>, a nonprofit organization that incentivizes the participation of low-income communities of color in public policy. 
</p>

<p>
Senator Robert Jackson and Assemblywoman Carmen de la Rosa -present at the meeting- are some of the local politicians who promise to support the plan’s implementation in public legislation.

<p>
Urban ecologist Zoé Hamstead explains that Inwood is a “micro-urban heat island” in Manhattan. This means that heat concentration is much higher there due to factors such as buildings’ designs and lack of green space. People who live in these areas are “unproportionally exposed to the health risks related to the heat,” such as dehydration or heat strokes which may be fatal and lead to hospitalizations.
</p>

<p> “Inwood has twice as many hospitalizations induced by heat compared to the rest of Manhattan,” said Sonal Jessel, We Act Policy and Advocacy Coordinator.
</p> 

<p> 
According to the city’s 2018 Community District 12 Health Profile report, Inwood residents also suffer from more economic stress that the rest of New Yorkers. This limits their access to heat relief such as air-conditioned spaces and newer buildings that take into account airflow in their designs.

<p>
There is a false concept that people of color and their elected officials aren’t concerned with environment issues,” said Congressman Adriano Espaillat during the presentation. “The reality is that people of color and low-income rank amongst the highest in polls as people who care about the environment and the weather and we can see this today.
</p>

<p>
We Act obtained public funds during the summer to conduct research in Inwood. They hosted four meetings where they conducted informational workshops about climate change and discussions to identify the community’s priorities.

<p>
During the presentation, the neighbors had the opportunity to criticize the summary of proposals redacted by We Act before it is formally presented to the authorities.
</p>

<p>
The participants were satisfied with the report, but skeptical about its implementation. Maggie Clarke, PhD in environmental science, has lived in Inwood for over 50 years and has participated in similar meetings. “Unfortunately these types of reports never go very far,” she said recalling the meetings that were held prior to the Inwood rezoning agreement.
</p>

<p>
Sonal Jessel said We Act cannot confirm if these recommendations will actually be implemented in the city, which is why the next step is to follow up with the authorities and continue the awareness efforts in the neighborhood.
</p>

<p>
We want to hear the community and learn of what they care about in order to know what legislation and policy we need to support,” said de la Rosa. “These types of meetings are important because ideas come directly from the community and that’s how government should work,” added the assembly woman.
