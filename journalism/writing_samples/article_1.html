<p> Ambient music at a pleasant volume, kids playing foosball while their parents order lunch on an iPad, a couple hugging as they contemplate the river. <a href="https://thehudson.nyc/" title="The Hudson" target="_blank"> The Hudson</a> is the latest restaurant to open at Dyckman Street Boat Marina Park, where two earlier venues were shut down by the authorities.
</p> 

<p> 
The atmosphere is in sharp contrast to what got the previous restaurant owners in trouble -- traffic and noise violations and drug dealing.

“Many of you have been tortured and I understand this,” said Jim Goldman, The Hudson’s owner, appearing before neighborhood residents at a Community District 12 meeting held last week. Goldman assured residents that he seeks to hone a family environment, that prices will be affordable, music will be kept at a respectable volume and that no parties will be hosted. “I know that you’ve heard it before, but in this case, actions speak, not words,” he said.

About a year before, The Hudson’s predecessor, La Marina, was the place with the best parties for some and the worst nightmares for others. Equipped with 18 speakers distributed across the beach and huge stages where iconic DJs livened the exclusive parties frequented by people from all over New York City who formed long lines/queues to get in the most “lit” place of the summer, where celebrities such as Jay-Z, Beyoncé and Leonardo Di Caprio have been spotted.

The park has a controversial past in regard to the management of the beach and the adjacent restaurant. A resolution by the Community District 12 states that MRG’s operations are to blame for over 2,2333 emergency calls to the NYPD in 2017, and for the neighbors not feeling safe due to the chaos caused by the overselling of tickets to the events and the valet parking service that operated in violation with the license agreement and transit laws.  “The music was unbearable”, said Nancy Preston, who has been a Dyckman street resident for over 20 years. “And you had to organize yourself around the schedule of the supposed restaurant to access your own community by vehicle,” she added.

Despite the constant complaints from the neighbors, the Parks Department spent years without being able to properly enforce the contract stipulations, which is why the community feels very skeptical about the new administration. David Cerron, Assistant Commissioner for Concessions and Internal Audit, explains that many changes were implement to provide Parks with more agency to do things differently. 
</p>

<p>
To start, the previous owners had two license concessions, one for the beach and another one for the restaurant. Now, the Parks Department manages the beach and The Hudson only has the concession for the restaurant, diminishing its capacity from 2,100 people to only 600 people. The language in this concession was modified by so that there are no doubts about the prohibition of valet parking services and in regard to the music volume and closing time. “People need a new beginning in this space,” said Cerron. “I hope that the judge’s order provides that,” he said.

At the end of the community meeting, the neighbors thanked Goldman for his goodwill. In time he will be able to gain the trust of Dyckman residents and demonstrate if this is really the beginning of something new and positive for the community.
