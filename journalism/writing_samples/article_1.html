<p> Ambient music at a moderate volume, kids playing foosball while their parents order lunch on an iPad, a couple hugging as they contemplate the river.  <a href="https://thehudson.nyc/" title="The Hudson" target="_blank"> The Hudson</a> is the latest restaurant to open at Dyckman Street Boat Marina Park, where the authorities shut down two earlier ones.
</p> 

<p> 
The atmosphere contrasts sharply to the problems that got the previous restaurant owners in trouble: traffic and noise violations, and drug dealing.

“Many of you have been tortured, and I understand this,” Jim Goldman, The Hudson’s owner, told neighborhood residents at a Community District 12 meeting last week. Goldman assured residents that he seeks to hone a family environment, that prices will be affordable, and music kept at a respectable volume. “I know that you’ve heard it before,” he said, “but in this case, actions speak, not words.”

Until last year, The Hudson’s predecessor, La Marina, owned by MRG, was the place with some people’s best parties and others’ worst nightmares. Equipped with 18 speakers positioned across the waterfront beach and huge stages where iconic DJs livened up exclusive parties frequented by people from all over New York City who formed long lines to get in the most “lit” place of the summer. Celebrities like Jay-Z, Beyoncé and Leonardo Di Caprio were spotted there.

The City park has a controversial past in terms of the management of the beach and the adjacent restaurant. A resolution by the Community District 12 states that MRG’s operations are to blame for over 2,233 emergency calls to the NYPD in 2017, and for  neighbors’ not feeling safe because of  the chaos caused by the overselling of event tickets and the valet parking service that violated the license agreement transit laws.  “The music was unbearable,” said Nancy Preston, who has lived on Dyckman Street  for over 20 years. “And you had to organize yourself around the schedule of the supposed restaurant to access your own community by vehicle.”

Despite the constant complaints, the Parks Department spent years unable  to enforce the contract stipulations properly, which is why the community feels very skeptical about the new management. David Cerron, assistant commissioner for concessions and internal audit, explains that many changes were implemented to provide the Parks  Department with more agency to do things differently.
</p>

<p>
To start, the previous owners had two license concessions, one for the beach and another for the restaurant. Now, the Parks Department manages the beach, and The Hudson has only the concession for the restaurant, diminishing its capacity from 2,100  to only 600. The language in this concession was modified by so that there are no doubts about the prohibition of valet parking services,  music volume and closing time. “People need a new beginning in this space,” said Cerron. “I hope that the judge’s order provides that.”

At the end of the community meeting, the neighbors thanked Goldman for his good will. Now his task is to gain the trust of Dyckman Street residents and demonstrate that The Hudson is really the beginning of something new and positive for the community.
