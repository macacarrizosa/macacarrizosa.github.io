<p> Manhattanâ€™s community district 12, comprised of Inwood and Washington Heights, was known to have the last affordable housing opportunities in Manhattan. However, in August 2018, Inwood was rezoned as part of an initiative by the NYCEDC, attracting wealthy developers and newcomers.
</p> 

<p>
The changes have stirred fear amongst residents. According to Assemblywoman Carmen De La Rosa, many of them are confused about what happened, about what the rezoning actually means and how it can affect their futures.
</p>

<p>
The map below shows the current zoning laws since the rezoning was approved. You can see the current zoning district law that applies for each property, what is currently built, and how much is allowed to be built (in floor area ratio) for three types of use: residential, commercial and facilities.

<p>
The area that was most affected is what is called the Special Inwood District (SID), highlighted in orange. By hovering on each property in this area one can see the difference in what is allowed in the SID versus the rest of the neighborhood.
</p>

<h2> The community's reactions to the changes </h2>


<p> 
The community board 12, which represents Inwood and Washington Heights claims that their proposals were not taken into consideration. Wayne Benjamin, chair of the committee for land use, says that the community actually wanted certain sectors of Inwood to be rezoned, but the rezoning that was passed is not in line with what they had proposed.
</p>


<p>
De La Rosa, revoked her support for the rezoning when she realized that the changes could displace the more vulnerable population. She also claims that the construction limits that were approved are out of character with the neighborhood. However, moving forward, she encourages residents to remain involved in policy and to participate in creating an organized agenda to protect small businesses and the Latino population that gives the district it's unique character.
