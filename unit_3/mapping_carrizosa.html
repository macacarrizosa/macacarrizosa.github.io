<p> Manhattan’s community district 12, comprised of Inwood and Washington Heights, was known to have the last affordable housing opportunities in Manhattan. However, in August 2018, Inwood was rezoned as part of an initiative by the NYCEDC, attracting wealthy developers and newcomers.
</p> 

<p>
The changes have stirred fear amongst residents. According to Assemblywoman Carmen De La Rosa, many of them are confused about what happened, about what the rezoning actually means and how it can affect their futures.
</p>

<p>
The following map shows the current zoning laws since the rezoning was approved. By clicking on each property one can observe the block and lot number, the year built it was built, the current zoning district law, the type of land-use, how much is currently built, and how much is allowed to be built (in floor area ratio) for three types of use: residential, commercial and facilities. You can also see the zoning that applied before the rezoning to compare the changes.

<p>
The area that was most affected is what is called the Special Inwood District (SID), highlighted in orange. Aside from changing the buildable limits, this area is subject to additional special conditions in order to meet the neighborhood’s specific needs.
</p>

<p> Zoning laws can be very complex and include several subcategories. For the purposes of analyzing this map, keep in mind that "Built Floor Area Ratio" (Built) is the total building floor area divided by the area of the tax lot and that when referring to zoning district law "R" is Residential, "C" is Commercial and "M" is Manufacturing. More in-depth information can be found in the <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/data-maps/open-data/pluto_datadictionary.pdf?r=19v2" title="Pluto Data Dictionary" target="_blank"> Pluto Data Dictionary.</a></p>

<p> As one can observe in the map, some areas will significantly change, such as the property on block 2187, lot 7 on West 207 St. right by the Harlem River. Residential buildings and facilities were not allowed to be built and now both are allowed and with the highest far limits in the neighborhood. This was one of the complaints heard at the community board meetings, where it was expressed that these heights are out of character with the neighborhood, and visible right as one enters Inwood from the Bronx. </p>

<p>These exponential changes are not carried out throughout all areas that were rezoned. Many of them remain unchanged and some limits were even reduced. </p>


<h2> The community's reaction to the changes: </h2>


<p> 
The community board 12, which represents Inwood and Washington Heights claims that their voices were taken into account. Wayne Benjamin, chair of the committee for land use, says that the community wanted certain sectors of Inwood to be rezoned, but the rezoning that was passed is not in line with what they had proposed.
</p>


<p>
De La Rosa, revoked her support for the rezoning when she realized that the changes could displace the more vulnerable population. She also claims that the construction limits that were approved are out of character with the neighborhood. However, moving forward, she encourages residents to remain involved in policy and to participate in creating an organized agenda to protect small businesses and the Latino population that gives the district its unique character.
