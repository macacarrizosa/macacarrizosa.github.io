<p> This month, NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio announced an increase of $5 billion in contracts for city certified women and minority-owned businesses (W/MBE). This is the third big increase to the total budget for W/MBE businesses for 2015-2025 contracts. In 2015, the target was to invest $16 billion dollars within a ten-year term, that target was raised to $20 billion last year and now it was raised to $25 billion in total. This increase is a huge step towards the City’s goal of awarding 30% of its contracts to W/MBE certified businesses by 2021. 
</p> 

<p> 
The program has been praised as a measure to break down barriers that have historically left certain populations out of the city’s contracting process. On the other hand, the 30% goal has also been criticized by some contractors because they say that there aren’t enough W/MBE’s. According to data from NYC Open Data, women and minority-owned businesses represent about 5% of DCA licensed businesses. 
</p>

<iframe title="Percentage of W/MBE Businesses in NYC" aria-label="Stacked Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-Hec9F" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Hec9F/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="626"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}})}();</script>


<p>
The chart above compares the number of DCA licensed businesses with the quantity of W/MBE certified businesses, in the past 20 years, by their date of establishment. There is no information provided in this dataset about the date in which the businesses obtained their W/MBE certification. The reason there is a significant drop in the number of W/MBE certified businesses after 2017 is that businesses are required to have been operational for a year before they can apply.
</p>


<p>
The data shows that the older the business, the larger the percentage of W/MBE certified businesses relative to all DCA licensed businesses for that year. This makes sense as some business owners may take longer to get the certification, however, given the significant increases in the budget it’s surprising that more of the newer businesses aren’t applying for the certification.
